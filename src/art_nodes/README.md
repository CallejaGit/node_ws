# Compiling

The node you created should be in utra_nodes/src.

The file you created for the node has to be declared as an executable.

`add_executable(<executable> src/<corresponding node>.cpp)`  
`target_link_libraries(<executable> ${catkin_LIBRARIES})`

replace <executable> for whatever name you choose for the executable and <corresponding node> with the node you created.

Build our workspace using catkin_make command in the workspace directory

`cd your_workspace`  
`catkin_make`

To start the node, 
`rosrun utra_nodes <executable>`   
Where executable is the name you chose for the executable
